The food was very oily. 3/5 days they sent potato curries which were oily and watery. Very unappetizing! As far as I am concerned, they lost a customer who cherished home made Gujarati food. Also some of the weeks the Friday food used to be same as other days food whereas they have mentioned that Wednesday and Fridays food will be different. Anyways thumbs down for this. I give 2 only for the older times.",

Cold food\n3. Worst customer service. No contact number. No place to raise problems or get an immediate answer.",

It has fewer portions than most and tastes nowhere near what a street food item tastes like.\n\nI 100% DO NOT recommend this place.\n\nTLDR; Bland or sweet taste in all the dals and sabzis.

Taste was decent but the portions were highly disproportionate. I got 6 unbaked pav breads for the meal which was not enough carb portions to what i ordered.

Raajma chawal couldn\u2019t be any better, very, very good. But, the best part for me was Bhindi, I really love bhindi but I\u2019m not often able to cook it myself and at those times I miss mom ke haath ki bani bhindi, which I haven\u2019t gotten an opportunity to have in almost a decade now, maybe even more. And the bhindi I got in this tiffin was divine, surreal, just like my mom\u2019s. Brought so many nostalgic memories of India. I wish they offered it in bigger quantities, 8 oz was just not doing justice to such lip smacking bhindi. Compliments to the cook.",
